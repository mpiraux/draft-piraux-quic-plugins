                      draft-piraux-quic-plugins-00

Abstract

   This document proposes a new mechanism for extending the QUIC
   protocol dynamically.  QUIC Plugins allows modifying the behavior of
   a QUIC peer on a per-connection basis.  These plugins run inside a
   sandboxed environment monitoring their executions.  They can be
   combined to add their functionalities to a given QUIC connection.

   This document is a straw-man proposal.  It aims at sparking
   discussions on the proposed approach.  TODO(mp): Encourage a place
   (ml ?) to discuss the approach

3.  What is a plugin ?

   TODO(mp): Change the section title, I don't like it

   A QUIC Plugin consists of platform-independent bytecode which modify
   or extend the behavior of a QUIC implementation.  This document
   consider the behavior of a QUIC implementation as a set of functions,
   also named protocol operations.  Adding the functionality of a QUIC
   Plugin, i.e. adding or replacing a set of protocol operations, to a
   QUIC connection is refered to as injecting a QUIC Plugin.  Injecting
   a plugin is limited to a given connection.

   Its bytecode is run inside a sandboxed execution environment.  It
   access to the state of a QUIC connection through a restricted API.

   The scope of a QUIC Plugin is restricted by both the limitations of
   this execution environment, e.g. in terms of instruction set and
   quantity, and by the surface exposed by this API, e.g. the quantity
   of state that can be read from or written to by a plugin.  The API
   also defines a set of protocol operations to which QUIC Plugins can
   be injected.  For instance, a QUIC implementation might restrict QUIC
   Plugins injection to its acknowledgment generation policy, e.g. the
   protocol operation deciding whether sending an ACK frame is needed.

   A QUIC Plugin can be injected by several means.  The application can
   inject plugins to tune its underlying QUIC connection.  QUIC peers
   can exchange and inject plugins over a QUIC connection, as described
   in Section 6.  Users can set a default configuration to inject
   plugins on their devices.

4.  Examples of use-cases

   There exist several cases in which being able to modify the behavior
   of a QUIC peer is beneficial.  [PQUIC] demonstrates how this approach
   can be used to deploy existing QUIC extensions such as Multipath QUIC
   [I-D.deconinck-multipath-quic] and [QUIC-FEC].  This first version of
   the document focus on enabling the extension of simpler QUIC
   mechanisms.  Three of them are documented in this section.
   Contributions regarding new uses-cases are welcomed.

Internet-Draft                QUIC Plugins                 February 2020


4.1.  Application-driven stream scheduling

   QUIC streams allow the application to multiplex several bytestreams
   over a single QUIC connection.  Yet, the QUIC specification does not
   provide a mechanism for exchanging prioritization information nor for
   indicating the relative priority of streams.  As described in
   Section 2.3 of [I-D.ietf-quic-transport], A QUIC implementation
   SHOULD provide ways in which an application can indicate the relative
   priority of streams.  A QUIC implementation could allow QUIC Plugins
   to extend or override its stream scheduler.

   A proposal for stream prioritisation for HTTP/3 already exists
   [I-D.kazuho-httpbis-priority].  Instead of defining a communication
   interface between the application and the QUIC implementation for
   indicating the priority and scheduling of QUIC streams, a QUIC Plugin
   could directly implement the required behavior.  [LNBIP2020]
   evaluates stream scheduling for HTTP/3 and claims that performances
   are heavily impacted by the adopted stream scheduling.

   For other applications over QUIC with a broad range of requirements,
   a flexible approach for defining the stream scheduling policy is key
   to best fit their needs.  QUIC Plugin offer a flexible way to embed
   application knowledge inside the QUIC implementation.

4.2.  Pluggable congestion controller

   There exists many congestion control algorithms.  Each of them has
   been designed for a given context, i.e. a range of applications and a
   range of Internet paths.  For instance, Reno [TODO] has been designed
   for optimizing the web use-case on common Internet paths.  Westwood
   [TODO] is a modification of Reno to better accommodate Internet paths
   with a high bandwidth-delay product, such as satellite links.

   Efforts to restructure congestion controllers within a common
   framework have been presented in past works such as [CCP].  Such a
   framework eases the development and maintenance of those algorithms.
   It also enables rapid prototyping and A/B testing.

   [TCP-Options-BPF] proposes a new TCP Option, leveraging the TCP-BPF
   framework, to negotiate the congestion controller to use.  The QUIC
   specification does not specify a similar mechanism.  Negotiating the
   congestion controller used allows one endpoint to tune the other,
   provided that it implements the algorithm.  QUIC Plugins could allow
   the application to directly plug the required congestion controller
   and to exchange it with the other peer.  This flexibility allows the
   application to choose the best congestion controller for its
   requirements.

4.3.  Tunable acknowledgments policy

   The large diversity of Internet paths also counts networks involving
   a significant path asymmetry.  Those paths often impact the ability
   of the receiver to provide feedback to the sender.  The performance
   of transport protocols such as TCP has been studied in depth and
   reported in [RFC3449].  A method for controlling the rate of receiver
   feedback of TCP, i.e. the rate of ACKs, has been proposed in
   [RFC5690].

   Proposals for controlling the acknowledgment policy of QUIC already
   exist.  [I-D.fairhurst-quic-ack-scaling] proposes a change to the
   default policy for asymmetric paths.  [I-D.iyengar-quic-delayed-ack]
   describes a QUIC extension enabling a QUIC endpoint to control the
   acknowledgment policy of its peer.  For that purpose, they model the
   acknowledgment policy depending on a few parameters and introduce a
   new QUIC frame to signal new values for those parameters.

   A QUIC Plugin could allow implementing a new acknowledgment with a
   fine granularity.  For example, in the case of an application that
   generates bursty trafic, such as a real-time video streaming
   application, a QUIC Plugin allows to embed application knowledge,
   i.e. the characteristics of such bursts, inside the acknowledgment
   generation policy.  Exchanging and injecting this plugin allows
   controlling the other peer behavior.

5.  Injecting/accepting QUIC Plugins

   Injecting a QUIC Plugin to a QUIC implementation requires several
   modifications.  First, an execution environment is required to
   execute the plugin, as it is not consisting of executable machine
   code.  This environment executes the bytecode of QUIC Plugins.  This
   bytecode is portable and has a limited instruction set, such as eBPF
   or WebAssembly bytecode.  The plugin runs thus in an isolated
   environment inside the QUIC implementation.

   The QUIC implementation is responsible for interacting with the
   plugin, i.e. running its bytecode and providing restricted access to
   the QUIC connection state.  For example, a QUIC implementation that
   accepts plugins deciding whether an acknowledgment has to be sent
   should execute the plugin everytime this decision is considered and
   provide access to relevant state for computing this decision.  A QUIC
   implementation that accepts plugins implementing a congestion
   controller may provide write access to some state, for example the
   congestion window of a given path, so that the plugin can modify the
   state of the QUIC connection.

6.  Exchanging QUIC Plugins

   Injecting QUIC Plugins locally in the underlying QUIC implementation
   allows the application to tune it to its needs.  But some use-cases
   requires adapting the peer behavior.  In those cases, being able to
   exchange plugins helps to fill that gap.

   In order to negotiate the use of QUIC Plugins, new transport
   parameters could be used to announce the plugins that should be
   injected.  Each QUIC peer announces the plugins it supports and the
   plugins that it would like to inject to the other peer.  A local
   policy could restrict the type of plugins that can be exchanged and
   injected.  Once the QUIC handshake completes and the QUIC Plugins
   transport parameters have been exchanged, plugins exchange can take
   place next to the data transfer, using a new dedidcated stream type
   akin to the crypto stream.

7.  Trusting QUIC Plugins

   Each QUIC Plugin MUST be associated to some level of trust regarding
   its origin.  For instance, a QUIC Plugin MAY be authenticated using a
   certificate.  A QUIC implementation accepting plugins MAY restrict
   the exchange of QUIC Plugins and only accept plugins authenticated
   using the same certificate used for establishing the QUIC connection.

   A QUIC endpoint MAY forbid the injection of received QUIC Plugins,
   while still being able to send QUIC Plugins to its peer.
